				<p> Insert game name here <!--We haven't named the game yet --> is a story driven, post apocalyptic, resource managment, tower defense game where the goal of the game is to
					explore areas, collect resources, and search for survivals in a post apocalyptic wasteland while being attacked by giant bugs. 
					The game will be centered around a giant, either mech or tammed bug writers haven't decided, which is where you build your base
					to with stand the attacks from the bugs.
